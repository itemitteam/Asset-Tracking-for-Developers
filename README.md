## 🛠️ Asset Tracking for Developers: Why itemit is the "Source of Truth" for Your Hardware

As developers, we obsess over version control for our code. We use Git to know exactly who changed what, when, and why. But when it comes to the physical hardware that runs that code — servers, dev kits, IoT sensors, or high-end workstations — many teams are still stuck in the *pre-Git* era of messy spreadsheets.

**itemit is essentially version control for your physical assets.**

## 🚀 Why It Belongs in Your Tech Stack

If you’re managing a lab, a fleet of devices, or a remote-first engineering team, itemit bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds.

- **API-First Approach**  
  Don’t just manually enter data. Use the itemit API to trigger asset updates when a CI/CD pipeline finishes or when a device is provisioned.

- **Hardware Lifecycle Management**  
  Track a device from **Unboxed → In Production → Decommissioned**.

- **Automated Maintenance Logs**  
  Link hardware to its documentation. Scan a QR code on a rack to instantly pull up service logs or firmware versions.

- **Reduced "Tech Debt" in Operations**  
  Eliminate the "Ghost Asset" problem where budgets are drained by subscriptions and insurance for hardware that was scrapped months ago.

## 💻 The Developer Workflow

1. **Tag**  
   Assign a unique ID (QR, Barcode, or RFID) to the hardware.

2. **Sync**  
   Use the mobile app or API to map hardware to a specific user, location, or project.

3. **Audit**  
   Run automated reports to ensure your physical inventory matches your digital records.
